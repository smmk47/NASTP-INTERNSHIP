# NASTP- Android Development INTERNSHIP

This repository documents the advanced-level Android development tasks and concepts I mastered during my internship. The tasks span from intricate activity lifecycle management to the deployment of a fully functional Android application.

## Activity Lifecycle and Intents

Developed a comprehensive understanding of the Android activity lifecycle, managing various states such as `onCreate`, `onStart`, and `onResume`. Implemented efficient navigation between multiple activities using Intents, including the use of Intent Filters for advanced activity communication.



## Advanced UI Components and Material Design

Mastered the use of advanced UI components like RecyclerView, CardView, and Toolbar. Applied Material Design principles to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Customized themes and styles to ensure a cohesive and polished look across the application.



## Data Storage and Networking

Implemented local data storage solutions including SharedPreferences, SQLite, and Room for robust data management. Developed proficiency in working with JSON data and making network requests using Retrofit and Volley. Managed asynchronous operations using Coroutines and AsyncTask, enabling efficient data fetching and display from remote APIs.



## Debugging, Testing, and Deployment

Enhanced debugging skills using Android Studio tools. Wrote and executed comprehensive unit tests with JUnit and Mockito, and performed UI testing using Espresso. Prepared the app for release by signing and packaging it, gaining a thorough understanding of the deployment process, including optional publishing on the Google Play Store.
